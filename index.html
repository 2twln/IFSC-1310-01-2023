  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>â€‹Web accessibility is important to ensure that no one is excluded from accessing information on the internet. <br>
    It is important to know that "disabled" refers to a wide range of conditions. Accessibility involves much more <br> 
    than screen readers for visually impaired people; it is about ensuring everyone can access the web and its resources.</p>
